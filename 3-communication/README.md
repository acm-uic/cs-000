Start from scratch make a project, throw it away.

in the industry, you don't get to do that.

in the industry you inherit a codebase, which has existed for years if you're lucjt and decades if you aren't.

comments in code

in school you wirte comments explaing the code..
in the industry you have to write comments explaning WHY you writote it . including the context behind it.
this is an assumption i made during this time. in the futire it may not be valid. check that.

code is very readable in high level launguates.

good intvertview skill. take a block of code, turn it into a prose in english
being able to speak fluently in code -> english

comments are baout providing another channel for information, another band that you can use to coney information.

scala stuff

reify (from latin of thing). take domain knolwege and turn it into a procedure

....

"coding as a conversation"

your job is communication. though code, documentation, etc. 
your domain expertise is about taking aprblen and translating that into processes and theachign those to a computer. 
To do that you need to have an understanding of the problem through managers/PMs. your job is to interrogate what they really want and take that and turn it into a process. 

sometimes it's impossiblle, it's your job to talk to them and propose a solitionm.

communication  ettiquitte

it's an important skill to review and be reviewed.
be a part of a workflow where you read co-workers code.
being able to review and accept review is an importatn skill (based on the team you end up on)

there are diffrerent styukes
some peiple are new age, hippie dippie, diplomatic
others are just the facts. 

br sinsitive and read the room/channel see how people commuinicate and participate in tthat styles. be mroe diplocamtic incase you misjudge things.

choosing what to pick out in other peoples review is an importatn skill
don't fixate oon surface levl style. (newlines, indent this differently)

how to suppress a commit in git log (follw up on this)

don't get hung up on the details when reviewing.

focus on : is thiuns confusing or is lieklyu to cause a bug.

if something does not amke sense ask them to clarify.

niches = nerd cred

having a niche is good
