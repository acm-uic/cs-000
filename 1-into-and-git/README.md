# Intro and Git


## CS 100?

Not a course. It's what I think is prerequisite knowledge for working in the industry, open source, research fields which is not really covered in classes.

Also take a look at [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

## What are we going to talk about?

- Essentials like Git, Linux, Workflows, Debugging
- Demystify buzzwords such as Blockchain, DevOps, Cloud.
- Invite speakers (people with industry experience, alumni) to talk about their what they found lacking in their education and teach and talk about that.
